        <h2>Mozengi</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Moses from Nigeria, West Africa. 
        I am passionate about writing codes to solve real life problems and also thrilled about the visual appearance of webpages.</p>
        <p>I truly want to contribute to my community by offering free computer literacy classes to kids from poorly-funded Government schools in my neighborhood.</p>
        <p>I am determined to make a run at Software Development at BYU Idaho as the program is well-packed, courses are properly structured and the resources are loaded.<br> I love learning new things and meeting people from different time zones. 
        I am filled with excitment as to what the future holds on this educational journey. </p>
